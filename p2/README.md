JavaScript and NodeJS
=====

## What is here?

This is all the files we went over. What to do if you download this file.

Remove node_modules and makes sure you have nodejs installed. Do a 'npm install' and it will get all the dependencies for you. From here you can run 'node app.js' and you will have to go to 'localhost:8888' and you can click submit and you will recieve it on the backend. It will log and and the page will freeze. Try messing around with the requests and sending back data. Any questions let me know.

## Tutorials

We do not have a class next week due to midterms. We will go in depth in nodejs (expressjs) the week after that (2/20). It is really important to understand and know the stuff we have covered so far in the next 2 weeks. Use the following resources:

JavaScript Guide - JavaScript | MDN
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide
https://github.com/SudoSoldiers/WebDev/tree/master/p2

Jade tutorial
http://jade-lang.com/tutorial/

jQuery tutorial

Node basics

Also, if you do not know where to get started learning JS, go here: https://github.com/karan/Projects - It's a list of projects that you can solve as you learn the language.

On 2/20, we will do real live coding and build a web app from scratch using Node.js, Express.js, Jade, Bootstrap (and maybe MongoDB). So, I highly, highly recommend that you learn all the posted material. Let us know if there's questions.
