JavaScript and NodeJS
=====

We do not have a class next week due to midterms. We will go in depth in nodejs (expressjs) the week after that (2/20). It is really important to understand and know the stuff we have covered so far in the next 2 weeks. Use the following resources:

JavaScript Guide - JavaScript | MDN
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide
https://github.com/SudoSoldiers/WebDev/tree/master/p2

Jade tutorial
http://jade-lang.com/tutorial/

jQuery tutorial

Node basics

Also, if you do not know where to get started learning JS, go here: https://github.com/karan/Projects - It's a list of projects that you can solve as you learn the language.

On 2/20, we will do real live coding and build a web app from scratch using Node.js, Express.js, Jade, Bootstrap (and maybe MongoDB). So, I highly, highly recommend that you learn all the posted material. Let us know if there's questions.
